#### BIO

I always have a story to tell, since 2002 I have been a co-founder of several successful startups, but I have also had many failures that have given me a lot of experience.

I have also been C-level in many small and medium size companies, I have built highly cohesive teams.

I have played on the backend, on the front end, on mobile, and in DevOps.

I love functional programming, languages like `Scala`, `Clojure` and `Elixir`.

I am the author of some books related to [massive data processing](https://www.amazon.com/Raul-Estrada/e/B07813X7YQ)
